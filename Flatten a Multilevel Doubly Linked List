You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, 
it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. 
These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, 
as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. 
You are given the head of the first level of the list.

用递归暴力解
Example:

Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
