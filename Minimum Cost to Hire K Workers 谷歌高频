There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

 

Example 1:

Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
Example 2:

Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
 

Note:

1 <= K <= N <= 10000, where N = quality.length = wage.length
1 <= quality[i] <= 10000
1 <= wage[i] <= 10000

使用了一个大根堆，来获取K个工人的最大的价性比，作为K个工人的价性比，使用qsum保存K个工人的质量和。要给他们付的工资就是qsum * 最大性价比。

时间复杂度是O(Nlog(N))，空间复杂度是O(N)。
class Solution(object):
    # we need while least wage, and least quality
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality, wage, K):
        # this sort garentee the later one wont need larger cost
        works = [(w/float(q), q) for w,q in zip(wage, quality)]
        works.sort()
        pq = []
        qsum = 0
        res = float('inf')
        for rate, q in works:#rate the lower the better, so use max heap, use -
            heapq.heappush(pq, -q)
            qsum += q
            if len(pq) > K:
                pop = heapq.heappop(pq)
                qsum += pop # reduce largest quality
            if len(pq) == K:
                res = min(res, qsum*rate)
        return res
