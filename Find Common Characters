Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings
within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times,
you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

class Solution(object):
    def commonChars(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        res = collections.Counter(A[0])
        for a in A:
            res &= collections.Counter(a) # &操作只会保留同时出现的数
        return list(res.elements())
