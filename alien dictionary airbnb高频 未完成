There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. 
However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list ofnon-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. 
Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
这个能知道w < e < r. r< t< f. 
The correct order is: "wertf".

Example 2:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x"
]
The correct order is: "zx".

Example 3:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]
The order is invalid, so return "".

Note:

You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

这道题让给了我们一些按“字母顺序”排列的单词，但是这个字母顺序不是我们熟知的顺序，而是另类的顺序，
让我们根据这些“有序”的单词来找出新的字母顺序，这实际上是一道有向图遍历的问题，
跟之前的那两道 Course Schedule II 和 Course Schedule 的解法很类似

def alienOrder(word):
    degree = {}
    nodes = set()
    for word in words:
        for c in word:
            nodes.add(c)
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        if
