问题：设计一个只读的lookup service
  10 billion key-value pair
  (not updated every day)
  Key: Geolocation; Value; image and building name
  
  Senario 比较明确 lookup
   How big is the data? how big is the key, and value?
      key(Latitude)
        each key size<20B
        Total key size = 200GB
      value(pic and all the building name on this pic)
          Each Value size = 100kb
          total value size = 1PB

Service: App client + web service + storage service

Storage:
    可选的有HashMap
    Databse
    GFS
    
怎么sharding?
Horizontal Sharding

How to solve big size problem?
把所有数据放在GFS里

For given key, how do we know which chunk we should 
答：chunk index
