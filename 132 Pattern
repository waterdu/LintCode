Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak 
such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n 
numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

Note: n will be less than 15,000.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

            if n < s3:
                return True
            #garentee right is smaller than n
            while stack and stack[-1] < n:
                s3 = stack.pop()
            stack.append(n)
        return False
