Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), 
and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.
For example, “great acting skills” and “fine drama talent” are similar, 
if the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, 
if “great” and “fine” are similar, and “fine” and “good” are similar, “great” and “good” are not necessarily similar.
However, similarity is symmetric. For example, “great” and “fine” being similar is the same as “fine” and “great” being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = ["great"], 
words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. 
So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2 = ["doubleplus","good"].

Note:

The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].

给定两组单词words1和words2，以及一组相似单词对pairs，判断words1与words2中的单词是否两两相似。
利用字典similars存储相似单词对，然后遍历words1和words2即可

Python代码：
class Solution(object):
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, words1, words2, pairs):
        n1 = len(words1)
        n2 = len(words2)
        if n1 != n2:
          return False
        similar = collections.defaultdict(set)
        similar = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for w1,w2 in pairs:
          similar[w1].add(w2)
          similar[w2].add(w1)
        for w1, w2 in zip(words1,words2):
          if w1 != w2 and w1 not in similar(w2):
            return False
        return True
